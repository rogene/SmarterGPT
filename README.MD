This is a quick Python implementation of a smarter GPT query that leverages engineered prompts to encourage GPT to think more carefully before answering. The program takes in a question, assumes relative complexity, and queries GPT n times (default == 2) to collect the answers. The program then uses GPT to compare and contrast the answers to come up with a final answer. The program is built using Streamlit to make it a web app.

The program starts by initializing the Streamlit app and prompting the user to input a question. The user is then prompted to select a model from a list of available models. Once the user submits the question and selects a model, the program initializes several chains that are used to process the question and generate the final answer.

The program uses several prompt templates to guide the GPT model in generating the answers. The initial question prompt template is used to prompt the user to answer the question carefully and reflect on their answer. The double-checker prompt template is used to prompt the user to double-check the question and answer to ensure that they are correct. The comparison prompt template is used to prompt the user to compare and contrast the answers generated by GPT. The final answer prompt template is used to prompt the user to find the best answer based on a compare-contrast opinion. Finally, the summary prompt template is used to prompt the user to summarize the final answer to be more concise and straight to the point.

The program uses several LLM chains to process the question and generate the final answer. The question chain is used to process the initial question and generate the initial answers. The sequential chain is used to process the answers generated by the question chain and generate the final answer. The program also uses several input and output variables to pass data between the chains and templates.

Once the user submits the question and selects a model, the program processes the question and generates the final answer. The program then displays the final answer to the user. If the user has enabled debug mode, the program also displays the initial and checked answers generated by GPT.
